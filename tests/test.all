18 Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classifications
.A
Comaromi, J.P.
.W
   The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal
Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published
in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions
will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's
long and healthy life, however, its full story has never
been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey
that briefly describe his system, but this is the first
attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that
more than any other has spurred the growth of
librarianship in this country and abroad.

Use Made of Technical Libraries
.A
Slater, M.
.W
This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use
in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom.
Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of
information use.  Information transfer in libraries is
restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no
account of documents used outside the library, still
less of information transferred orally from person
to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a
proportion of the situations in which information is
transferred.
Taking technical information transfer as a whole,
there is no doubt that this proportion is not the
major one.  There are users of technical information -
particularly in technology rather than science -
who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk
collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal
contact with their colleagues and with people in other
organizations.  Even regular library users also receive
information in other ways.
